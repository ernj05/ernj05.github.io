### Favorite CPSC 120L Labs
* Lab 5, part 2

  This lab was cool because we had to convert feet to inches. This was cool because we made a calculator, which we can use for real-life situations. It helped us understand how to convert decimals into integers using static_cast.

* Lab 6, part 1 

  This lab was fun because we created a message based on arguments given by the user. It took the input and could output a message using condiments for sandwiches. I like this because I love food; it was one of the fun labs. It helped us understand how to use arguments.

* Lab 4, part 2

  This lab was fun because it was an actual game. The hi-lo game was cool because it determined whether the number you picked was higher or lower than the number. It allowed us to understand how to use if and if else statements.
